# Awesome-Competitive-Programming
A curated list of awesome competitive programming / algorithm / data structure materials.

TODOs:

1. Better descriptions.
2. More great resources from other regions (eg. Russian scene, BR ICPC Camp)
3. ICPC News site (eg. snarknews)
4. A short reference sheet

*This repository is currently not associated with the official [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).  
For the time being I'm still looking to improve on the current contents before submitting a PR.*
